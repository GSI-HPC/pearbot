    Example #1:
    Change:
    ```diff
    + fi

    +if [[ $2 =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    +    msgSize=$1
    ```
    Suggestion:
    The assignment of msgSize is incorrect; it should be assigned the value of $2 instead of $1:
    ```diff
    -    msgSize=$1
    +    msgSize=$2
    ```

    Example #2:
    Change:
    ```diff
    + xterm -geometry 90x40+550+40 -hold -e @EX_BIN_DIR@/$PROCESSOR1 &
    +
    + PROCESSOR2="fairmq-ex-region-processor"
    + PROCESSOR2+=" --id processor1"
    ```
    Suggestion:
    There seems to be a copy-paste error. The `PROCESSOR2` should have a unique identifier, but it is currently set to `processor1`, which is the same as `PROCESSOR1`. This should be corrected to ensure that each processor has a unique ID.
    ```diff
    -    msgSize=$1
    +    msgSize=$2
    ```
